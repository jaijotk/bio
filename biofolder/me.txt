My name is Jai Jot Kaur.
I am a third year student at UC Merced majoring in Human Biology.
I am currently working on applications, working, studying while making time to spend time with friends and family.
I enjoy bike riding, watching movies, and scrapbooking.

Hi! It is September 27, and I am doing an individual activity. This is a modification I made.
